`git clone https://github.com/jtams/nvim-config.git "${XDG_CONFIG_HOME:-$HOME/.config}"/nvim`

# Planned Changes/Research for 2025

- [ ] Look into mini.nvim
- [ ] Look into adding vim.lsp.buf.code_action() for "Fix Available" actions
- [ ] Change the way I handle switching files. Possibly change my harpoon/grapple keybinds or use another plugin. [Snipe](https://github.com/leath-dub/snipe.nvim) looks cools. [Reference video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ldfxEda_mzc).
- [ ] Look into debugging
- [ ] Look into switching from Copilot or changing plugins to include a chat.
- [ ] Add descriptions to the keybinds
- [ ] Change keybinds for surround or use different plugin
- [ ] Redo conform
- [ ] Look for better plugin to display/pick colors
- [ ] Find better keybinds for splits
- [ ] Move file explorer to side
- [ ] Better hex editing?
- [ ] Better configuration for UFO
- [ ] Go over telescope keybinds (and possible missed features)
- [ ] [Multicursor](https://github.com/jake-stewart/multicursor.nvim)
